 [+] Welcome to LegionOS ! Yet another linux distribution based on Arch Linux
 [+] In this file, you will get some help regarding how to work in this system



 [-] Some keyhighlights

    1. This distribution is optimized for best performance hence using the custom
     patched Linux-Tkg-BMQ kernel.

    2. It uses BTRfs modern CoW file system as default with ZSTD compression 
     and mounted with optimization options.

    3. Alikred - A system settings CLI-based application that helps to handle 
     various system tasks with ease thus providing easy option for new linux users. 

    4. LegionOS is built on top of Arch Linux which is a rolling release Linux 
     Distribution and using the main stream repositories for packages only.

    5. Chaotic-AUR repository enabled by default thus providing access access a large pool
     of packages.
  
    6. A heavily customized BSPWM, a dynamic tilling window manager with blazing fast 
     alacritty terminal.

    7. Weekly scheduled System backups hence even if the system is corrupted, it can be 
     rolled back to its initial stage.

    8. Many custom built application come installed accessable using alikred

    9. To be frank, Linux Mint was my daily driver about 3 years ago and to support the 
     Ubuntu, Debian community a little, I have created a custom pkg script with similar syntax.



 [-] Some Shortcuts to quickstart:
    start + enter         == alacritty terminal
    start                 == Favourite Apps
    start + space         == All Apps   
    alt   + space         == System Settings
    start + r             == Run
    start + space + n     == Wi-Fi settings
    start + shift + q     == close current window
    start + [             == previous workdspace
    start + ]             == next workspace
    start + shift + s     == Screenshot


 [-] Some of the defualt Applications that are installed are:
    1. Alikred                     (Legion Command Centre, A settings manager built from scratch)
    2. Firefox and Tor-Browser
    3. Alacritty Terminal Emulator
    4. Nemo file manager
    5. Neovim text editor and Neovide UI          (use 'nvim' and 'neovide' command to use it)
    6. Leafpad Editor                             (if you are not comfortable with cli editor)
    7. Nitrogen Wallpaper Setter
    8. Alikred (CCM) System Monitor 
    9. LXAppearance		                            (for Look and Feel)
   10. Ncmpcpp Music Player                       (store music in $HOME/Music folder)


 [-] System Applications and Native Apps
    1. Legion Command Centre                      (alikred)
    2. Legion System Monitor                      (ccm)
    3. Legion System Maintainance                 (system-maintain)
          
    
    Note : They are not GUI but TUI Applications as I was facing problems with 
           providing GUI but I found TUI apps to be faster than them. I have a 
           rofi menu which could act as a GUI frontend to alikred.


          *but this is not all ;)


 [-] Most of the configs are built on top of default configs but special thanks to:
    Aditya Shakya           (for Rofi themes)
    Artur Gomes             (for beautiful NVIM config)
    Derek Taylor            (inspiration for ricing)
